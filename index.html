    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>My name is Truman. I am a prospective software engineer with interest in 
        HTML, CSS, Javascript, and C# (C-sharp). I have made interest calculators,
        utilized API's for social media platforms, and created script based log books
        for backend.
    </p>
    <p>If you follow the link for "Websites", it will redirect you to my Github
        portfolio and detail various team projects I have worked on, and some others
        that are currently in progress. I used to row for college and wanted to give
        to the team in some way. So I reached out to the current leadership and proposed
        the idea of donating a website to them for prospective members to reference the
        team with. Some things included on the website utilize weathers API's of reoccuring
        regetta's they participated in, a schedule of the teams work out. And the sitting
        president is able to login and make changes to the schedule as they please. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Some other interest of mine include photography, camping, disk golfing, canning,
        visiting museums, and trying different restaurants. And recently, coding;
        I have been practicing since June 2022 and haven't stopped since.
        There has been a lot of development since including the many projects listed
        under the websites button.
